# CUofSS Online Class Timetable
South Sudan University Time Table System is introduced to optimize the varsityâ€™s operation . Because of huge number of students and courses in campus nowadays, class scheduling for the cumpus is important due to the widely spread of technology. This system is proposed for the cumpus since they are still using paper-based system to create a class roster, units and course registration. This system is to manage the cumpus roster operation efficiently. The area consists of the administrator in campus who is conversant with the campus activities, lecturers and students. Basically there is no such systems in the campus around. The traditional paper-based roster management method has caused a lot of problems to the user. This system will help out the students and lecturers in the campus in managing their time.
